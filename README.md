# Time Management Tool for Rapidproto

- Track employee hours by day, week and per project/client
- Vacation planning, to be approved by the admin
- Adding Projects/Clients is admin only and E-Mail domain determines which holidays will be looked up (either German or Greek ones)

To be added/improved:

- Export time sheet to PDF each month for faster billing
- Optional blog/news page for the admin that the employees can see immediately on logging hours page
- Offer more/custom analytics
- Improve design

(Signup/Login parts from Learningdjango.com, but they turned out to be unnecessary. Still useful to play around with and learn, though).
